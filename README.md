## Hello Fresh : application for an internship as data scientist.


Using the *ukretail dataset*, i implemented a model to predict the **next order's value**.

- The Exploratory Data Analysis and Features selection are located on the R Notebook *helloFresh_dataExploration.md*
- Model building and validation on the Jupyter Python Notebook *HelloFreshModelValidation.ipynb*.


I found this assignement quite interesting, and due to the time constraints, i prefered to investigate the next the Purchase Order value rather than it's time. Intuitively, value is more deterministic than time.

With a ${R^2}$ close to 0.76 and unbalanced residuals, my main regret is not have focused on the predictive power of the **ProductStock** feature through clustering.


Please feel free to contact me for any further questions.

 
 CL.
